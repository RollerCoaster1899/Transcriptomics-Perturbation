# Transcriptomics Perturbation
Prediction of gene perturbation for top 978 genes based on the database "L1000 Dataset -small molecule perturbagens- LINCS Phase 1" (LDS-1481) in the LINDS Portal; The datbase includes the transcriptional profiles of cultured human cancer cell lines treated with small molecules: Expression of 978 representative genes is measured in 39 cell lines perturbed by 13 thousands of small molecules. This repository include the codes to data cleaning, training and predicting the gene perturbation of the new molecules by specifying only the molecule but also the celular line, the time after dosing and the concentration (uM).
